## Welcome to the Coursearch API reference!

This is the place to find official information on how to use Coursearch API in your projects.

The Coursearch API serves well formatted data about MOOCs across a few well known platforms. It can be used without any API token, membership, registration or payment. It supports a few parameters that can be applied to get just the right data you need. The usage is very simple and requires only basic knowledge of HTTP requests and JSON, XML, YAML or plain text.
